I decided to use Jekyll to power my personal site/blog, since github is already using it to generate its static sites.
Jekyll's docs could be little overwhelming. For example it was not too obvious that you can use markdown for regular pages, 
not only blog entries. Simply add a file with  `.md` extention and Jekyll will generate `.html` file. Pretty cool!

The best way to start is to generate example site with `jekyll new` command.

To run site locally, the way github would, use this command: `bundle exec jekyll serve -w`

As of Jekyll >= 0.12.1 redcarpet2 is natively supported by Jekyll, so you can simply set your config to 
`markdown: redcarpet` and you are good to go with GFM / fenced  code blocks like 
\`\`\`ruby 
instead of `{{ "{% highlight ruby " }}%}` liquid tags:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

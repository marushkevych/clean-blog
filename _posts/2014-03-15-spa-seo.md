Keep loosing [this](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started?csw=1)
page that explains solution proposed by google.

In short, for Angularjs app that doesnt use hashbang `#!` urls (recommended), you should:

- include a special meta tag in the head of the HTML of your page in order to make pages without hash fragments crawlable:

    ```html
    <meta name="fragment" content="!">
    ```
- provide crowlers with content for requests in this format:

    ```
    url?_escaped_fragment_=
    ```

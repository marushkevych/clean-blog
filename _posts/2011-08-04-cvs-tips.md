#### Update and overwrite local changes

```
cvs update -C -P -d
```

#### Merging with Eclipse.
* Do a *clean* check out the module to merge to and add as project to Eclipse
* Right click on project, chose (Team->Merge) from context menu
* select *End Tag* - branch or version to merge from.
    * Select a branch in order to merge whole branch: the branch will be merge at it current state (head of the branch)
    * Select a tag (on the branch to merge from) in order to merge a version of branch: the tagged version of branch will be merged use this approach if you planning to merge from that branch multiple times)
* select *Start Tag* - the point at which the branch was created, or, in case of multiple merge from the same branch - *End Tag* of *previous* merge.
* chose "Preview the merge in the synchronize view"
 

#### Tagging

##### Tagging the main trunk (head)

In order to name the current end of the main trunk of a module, use the command

```
cvs rtag Tagname modulename
```

##### Tagging the branch without checking out the from CVS.

In order to merge from a branch several times, we need to create an "End tag" on the branch.
The easiest way to tag a branch is the command:

```
cvs rtag -r Branchname Tagname modulename
```

#### To create a branch from a tagged revision of a module, use the command

```
cvs rtag -r Tagname -b Branchname modulename
```

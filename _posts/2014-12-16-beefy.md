Just discovered [beefy](http://didact.us/beefy) - great way to run your browserify app for development.

Very pleasant surprise is that beefy will replace any not existing resource with default index.html - great for single page apps. And it works great for angular apps with html5Mode enabled. So, instead of using [cumbersome regexp in connect modRewrite](/2014/03/26/angular-html5mode-refresh), you can run your app with beefy: 

```
beefy js/app.js:dist/bundle.js --index=index.html
```

We are telling beefy to dynamically bundle our app starting from js/app.js, and use this bundle whenever  ```<script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script>``` is requested. Also we telling beefy to use index.html whenever un-existing asset is requested - this will take care of browser refreshes and direct navigation with html5Mode.

Another advantage is that it "will spit compile errors out into the browser so you don't have that 1-2 seconds of cognitive dissonance and profound ennui that follows refreshing the page only to get a blank screen."

You can add scripts entry in your package.js to run beefy with ```npm start```:

```js
 "scripts": {
    "start": "beefy app/js/app.js:dist/bundle.js --index=app/index.html --cwd ./app"
  }
```
